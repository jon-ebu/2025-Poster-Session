# Table
[] Incorporate Sort by category toggle
[] Fix vertical scroll on mobile (continuously having problems)
[] Include an option to view table full screen (table becomes a footer that can be reopened)

# Map
[X] Click within map to hide info pane/unselect row
[X] Restrict Zoom on scroll and - button to whatever the default zoom is
[X] Make panning feel less stiff
[] Show a "Zoom in!" window on load with a little pinching animation
[] Change map controls to be brand colors

# Tooltips
[] Change tooltips to be brand colors (header primarily)
[] Increase length of tooltip arrow and have it look good (don't look disjointed, look like it's organically coming from tooltip bubble)

# Markers
[] When marker is focused on, fade the marker it shares the mount with
[] Fix bug when marker is focused on it stays in an increased size
[] See if slightly increasing the size of the markers across the board helps with readability

# Search
[] When there is only one result, automatically highlight the result after a small buffer window

Some restrictions:
- Mobile first app. Text should be relatively easy to read on mobile.
- Map should stay fixed location
- The only thing that should scroll is the table.
- Colors in circles in table should be consistent with map markers
- Search should be in a fixed location. Table headers should be frozen.
- Header on top should be fixed.
